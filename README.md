# Intuitive Deep Learning Assignment

This repository contains code and testing results from tutorials based on original author Joseph Lee.

## Part 1 - House Price Prediction Model

This part includes a neural network built using keras to predict prices of houses based on a model adapted from:

- [Build Your First Neural Network to predict house prices with Keras]  https://medium.com/intuitive-deep-learning/build-your-first-neural-network-to-predict-house-prices-with-keras-eb5db60232c

## Part 2 - CNNs for Image Classification

This part includes a convolutional neural network that was build using TensorFlow and Keras to classify CIFAR-10 images.  Model adapted from: 

 - [CNNs for computer vision] https://medium.com/intuitive-deep-learning/build-your-first-convolutional-neural-network-to-recognize-images-84b9c78fe0ce
